# Node Helpers

This is a set of helpers for node. They're written for quick reuse rather than robust functions or efficiency. For instance, the database functions will create a new database connection every time. This is not efficient, but it makes making the function call simple.

My use is primarily in quicker one off scripts that sometime morph into something long lasting...
